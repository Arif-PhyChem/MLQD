# MLQD- A Python package for Machine Learning-based Qauntum Dissipative Dynamics
We provide three Machine Learning (ML) methods in our package MLQD
* Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)-based recursive (iterative) Quantum Dissipative Dynamics method [Speeding up quantum dissipative dynamics of open systems with kernel methods](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ac3261 "Named link title")  which outperforms NN models as we have shown in this comparative study [A comparative study of different machine learning methods for dissipative quantum dynamics](https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/ac9a9d "Named link title")
