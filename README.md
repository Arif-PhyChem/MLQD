# MLQD- A Python package for Machine Learning-based Qauntum Dissipative Dynamics
We provide three Machine Learning (ML) methods in our package MLQD
* **Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)-based recursive (iterative) Quantum Dissipative Dynamics method:** [Speeding up quantum dissipative dynamics of open systems with kernel methods](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ac3261 "Named link title")  which outperforms NN models as we have shown in this comparative study [A comparative study of different machine learning methods for dissipative quantum dynamics](https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/ac9a9d "Named link title")
* **AIQD non-recursive  (non-iterative) approach:** [Predicting the future of excitation energy transfer in light-harvesting complex with artificial intelligence-based quantum dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29621-w "Named link title") 
* **The blazingly fast OSTL non-recursive (non-iterative) approach:** [One-Shot Trajectory Learning of Open Quantum Systems Dynamics]( https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01242 "Named link title")
